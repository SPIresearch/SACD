# SACD
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)  implementation on: Seeing your sleep stage: cross-modal distillation from EEG to infrared video.                                                                                    
      (A cross-modal distillation method based on infrared video and EEG signals)


## Introductio
We propose a novel cross-modal methodology (SACD) to solve the previous barriers, enabling point-of-care sleep stage monitoring at home.

To enable the developments of point-of-care healthcare research and distillation methods from clinical to visual modality, to our best knowledge, we are the first to collect a large-scale cross-modal distillation dataset, namely $S^3VE$
